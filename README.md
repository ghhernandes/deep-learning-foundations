# Deep Learning Foundations 

Deep Learning Foundations Algorithms with Numpy, PyTorch and Fast.ai.

The objective is build a state of the art deep learning model from scratch. 

## Roadmap 

As reference, i use [Fast.ai](https://course19.fast.ai/part2) course.

- [ ] Matrix Multiplication
- [ ] Foward and backward passes
- [ ] Loss functions
- [ ] Optimizers
- [ ] Training loop
- [ ] Callbacks and event handlers
- [ ] Data Block API and generic optimizer
### Matrix multiplication, foward and backward passes


### Loss Functions, optimizers, and the training loop


### Callbacks and event handlers


### Data Block API, and generic optimizer
